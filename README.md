# Neural-Machine-Translation

Neural Network that translates from English to German.

For the capstone project, you will use a language dataset from http://www.manythings.org/anki/ to build a neural translation model. This dataset consists of over 200,000 pairs of sentences in English and German. In order to make the training quicker, we will restrict to our dataset to 20,000 pairs. Feel free to change this if you wish - the size of the dataset used is not part of the grading rubric.

Your goal is to develop a neural translation model from English to German, making use of a pre-trained English word embedding module.
